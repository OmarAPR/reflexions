When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

  When I want to share my code, when I work in different computers, when
  I work in collaboration with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you don't want to make public every single version of the files,
  but only the validated ones. Maybe when adding complete characteristics
  or when finishing the work from one day.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

  Fork is the equivalent of clone, but only in GitHub. Clone is the operation
  of copying a repository with all the metadata of Git. And a branch is a
  division of the history of the commits, which can be merged with the master
  whenever the user prefers.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  You can know which changes have been made by other people since the last
  time you pulled.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  I would transfer the files of the project via WhatsApp or Facebook. The
  easier thing would be that everyone knows how to use those applications,
  hence we do not need to learn how to use Git and GitHub. The harder would
  be to compare the changes and merge them.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  When working on an experimental feature of the project. Also when working
  on independent features in a team. Each one can work in a different branch
  and merge them whenever they are done with their work.
