When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

  When I want to share my code, when I work in different computers, when
  I work in collaboration with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you don't want to make public every single version of the files,
  but only the validated ones. Maybe when adding complete characteristics
  or when finishing the work from one day.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

  Fork is the equivalent of clone, but only in GitHub. Clone is the operation
  of copying a repository with all the metadata of Git. And a branch is a
  division of the history of the commits, which can be merged with the master
  whenever the user prefers.
