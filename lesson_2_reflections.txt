What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates a directory called .git which contains all the metadata
    needed to keep track of the versions of all the files contained in the
    directory. I need to initialize it because Git will only consider my 
    directory as a reposity if I explicitly tell it through this command.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is an intermediate stage between the working directory and the
    repository. It allows to select which files are going to be included
    in the repository and which not (tracked or untracked)
